**PROJECTS**

* **Tanzanian Water Pump|ClassificationModel** | Pandas|Python|Jupyter Notebook|Numpy|Matplotlib|category\_encoder |    
*  [https://github.com/Izuchukwu1-king/Tanzanian-water-pump-predictions](https://github.com/Izuchukwu1-king/Tanzanian-water-pump-predictions)  
* Built a model to predict the functionality of the water pump.  
* Interpreted data for the water pump showed functional, non-functional and functional needs repairs  
* Purpose is to help the Tanzanian Government repair their water pump 

* Built a model that predicts home prices in Iowa|LinearRegression Model| Pandas|Python|Jupyter Notebook|Numpy|Matplotlib|category\_encoder |

**Chicago Food Inspection|LinearRegression Model|Python** | Pandas|Python|Jupyter Notebook|Numpy|Matplotlib|category\_encoder |  [https://github.com/Izuchukwu1-king/Chicago-Food-Inspection/blob/main/Copy\_of\_DS\_Sprint\_Challenge\_23.ipynb](https://github.com/Izuchukwu1-king/Chicago-Food-Inspection/blob/main/Copy_of_DS_Sprint_Challenge_23.ipynb)  
Built a model to predict whether a food establishment would pass inspection or not before the inspectors arrival

* Purpose is to help inspectors use their time more efficiently by identifying establishments that will likely fail inspection
